README
-> Python Libraries used -: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, OS, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Time, Python Imaging library

-> data_cleaning.ipynb is basically cleaning the dataset as in restricting them to 1000 images per label and resizing them into 300*300 pixels.

-> DS303Project.ipynb is the main file containing code for creating input array for storing images and output array for storing labels. Then a Convolutional Neural Network is made containing Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense and Droupout layers. 

-> We have saved weights of the model after training and that can be loaded as given in the last section of the code in DS303Project.ipynb with demo results.

-> While running the code in DS303Project.ipynb, a slight change has to made for MAC users. Code to be changed is mentioned in comments there.

-> We have created a separate folder containing Demo Images which can be found in ppt as well.

-> References and contribution of each members are mentioned in ppt.
